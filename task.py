    generating reports. If each goal is assigned to related themes, the user
    can have a report generated that states how much time he/she spent on

    (states/events to be avoided). This could be specified completely via the
    textual description of the goal, or it might be implemented on the code
    level. Goals are achieved by following (a sequence of) plans. There are
    usually multiple plans that can be chosen to achieve a goal. Goals can
    also involve subgoals, i.e. other objects of this class.

    Plan is a recipe how to achieve a specified target state from a specified
    initial state. Plans are parameterised by various circumstances,
    predominantly by the assignment of roles to real people, but also
    instantiations of salient objects, and subordinate (so-called delta) plans.
    For instance, the plan to buy a new piece of furniture involves a suitable
    instance of a furniture shop and a subordinate plan to get to the shop and
    bring the piece of furniture back home somehow. It might also involve
    a driver if the person him-/herself is not able to drive the thing home. In
    this plan, the initial state specification would include the person having
    enough money, time, and space at home. The final state would be fulfilling
    the goal of having the piece of furniture at home in the simpler case of,
    say, a couch; in a more complex case of a kitchen, for example, it would be
    followed by another plan for building the furniture into the final shape,
    until the goal is reached.

    Plans are composed of tasks (as far as I can see).

    Task is a (potentially recurrent) event with an actor, generally one that

    deadlines and belong to a plan, even if the plan should consist of a single
    task. There are all other sorts of attributes of tasks, which are to be
    determined as the implementation proceeds.

    Tasks can have a complex recurrency structure. The implementation should
    account for tasks such as ``Take a pill P each Monday and Thursday after
    breakfast.'' or ``Buy and paint eggs two weeks before Easter except for
